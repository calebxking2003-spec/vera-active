# ChatGPT AI Chatbot (Optional)
To add a real ChatGPT-powered chat widget you need an API key + a tiny backend (to keep the key private).
Recommended:
- Simple chat bubble UI on all pages
- Backend endpoint that calls OpenAI Responses API
- Rate-limit + safety filters
This repo includes only placeholders (no key in frontend).
